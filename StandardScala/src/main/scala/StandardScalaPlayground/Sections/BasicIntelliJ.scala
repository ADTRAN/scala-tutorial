  Some useful IntelliJ features & tips:
    1. Running an App - Click the green arrow next to the App
    2. Go to definition - Crtl + Click will take you to the definition/signature of whatever you're clicking --> [[VarsAndVals]]
    3. Mass comment - highlight + Crtl + / will mass comment/uncomment
    4. Rebuild with dependencies - After adding a dependency to build.sbt, you can click the "sbt" tab on the right column of the IDE, and click the cyclical arrow icon to refresh your dependencies. These can be viewed on the left hand column under External Libraries
    5. Optimize imports - Ctrl + Alt + o will optimize your imports (remove unused, group, etc.)
    6. Tabs - You can view more tabs at once (default is an annoying scroll bar) by clicking the three dots on the tab bar -> Configure Editor Tabs -> uncheck "Show tabs in one row", and increase the "Tab limit"
    7. Scaladocs - To generate a scaladoc above your method or class, enter / + ** and press enter. To generate a multiline comment, type / + ** + Space
    8. Find within a file - Ctrl + f
    9. Find and replace within a file - Ctrl + r
    10. Search within a project - Ctrl + Shift + f
    11. You can wrap text by clicking the left column next to the line numbers, and selecting "Soft-Wrap"
    12. If your IntelliJ breaks, a fix-all is to delete the entry for your version at /home/(your username)/.config/JetBrains, and restart the app
